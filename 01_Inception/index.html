 //createElemnt is an API provided by react which returns an object 
 //heading is an react element
    const heading = React.createElement("h1",{},"Namaste heading 1");
    const heading2 = React.createElement("h2",null,"namaste heading 2");

// console.log(heading)

    const container = React.createElement("div",{id:"container"},[heading,heading2,heading3])


//createRoot is also an API in reactDOM which creates a root and assigns an root element usually it is one only in entire DOM tree
//root tells react where to display or inject output
//createRoot lets you create a root to display React components inside a browser DOM node.
// createRoot returns an object with two methods: render and unmount.
// When you want to render a piece of JSX in a different part of the DOM tree that isn’t a child of your component (for example, a modal or a tooltip), use createPortal instead of createRoot.
    const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.querySelector("#root"));

//passing an react elemnt inside render method it takes an react element and modifies our DOM thus injecting heading inside DOM
// Call root.render to display a piece of JSX (“React node”) into the React root’s browser DOM node.
//  This will usually be a piece of JSX like <App />, but you can also pass a React element constructed with createElement(), a string, a number, null, or undefined.
// root.render returns undefined.
// The first time you call root.render, React will clear all the existing HTML content inside the React root before rendering the React component into it.
// If you call render on the same root more than once, React will update the DOM as necessary to reflect the latest JSX you passed. React will decide which parts of the DOM can be reused and which need to be recreated by “matching it up” with the previously rendered tree.
   
root.render(container);

//if your app is fully built with React, you shouldn’t need to create any more roots, or to call root.render again.

// From this point on, React will manage the DOM of your entire app. To add more components, nest them inside the App component. When you need to update the UI, each of your components can do this by using state. When you need to display extra content like a modal or a tooltip outside the DOM node, render it with a portal.






// Call root.unmount to destroy a rendered tree inside a React root.
// An app fully built with React will usually not have any calls to root.unmount
// This is mostly useful if your React root’s DOM node (or any of its ancestors) may get removed from the DOM by some other code. For example, imagine a jQuery tab panel that removes inactive tabs from the DOM. If a tab gets removed, everything inside it (including the React roots inside) would get removed from the DOM as well. In that case, you need to tell React to “stop” managing the removed root’s content by calling root.unmount. 

// root.unmount does not accept any parameters.
// root.unmount returns undefined.

// Calling root.unmount will unmount all the components in the tree and “detach” React from the root DOM node.

// Once you call root.unmount you cannot call root.render again on the same root. Attempting to call root.render on an unmounted root will throw a “Cannot update an unmounted root” error.
